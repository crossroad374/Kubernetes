Kubernetes Architecture Components

Master Node(Control Plane)

* API SERVER: Serves as the frontend of the kubernetes control plane. It exposes the kubernetes API, which is used by all components to communicate and manage the cluster.
* etcd : A distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data. It is the source of truth for the cluster's state.
* Controller Manager: Runs controller processes that regulate the state of the cluster, ensuring the desired state is maintained.
* Scheduler: Assigns workload(pods) to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.

Worker Node(Data Plane)

* Kubelet: An agent that runs on each worker node and ensures containers are running in pods as expected. It communicates with the API server.
* Kube-proxy: Manages network connectivity and load balancing for services running on the worker node.
* Container runtime: Software responsible for running containers(ex: Docker, containerd)

Pods: The smallest deployable units in k8S. Which can contain one or more containers. Pods share storage and network resources with each other via localhost.
