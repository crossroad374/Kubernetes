In K8s , a Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages the creation, updating and scaling of pods. They are used to make sure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. They handle the orchestration of pod creation, updates and rollbacks. It is defined using Yaml or JSON files.

Components:
ReplicaSet : Deployments create and manage ReplicaSets, which in turn manage the pods. A replicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
Pods: The actual instances of your application that are created and managed by the replicaSet.
